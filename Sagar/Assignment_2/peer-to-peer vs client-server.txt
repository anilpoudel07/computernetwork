Q. Differentiate between peer-to-peer and client-server network architecture.

Peer-to-peer (P2P) and client-server are two fundamental network architectures that define how devices communicate and share resources in a network. Hereâ€™s a comparison of the two:

 Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network Architecture:

1. Structure:
   - In a P2P network, each device (peer) has equal status and can act as both a client and a server.
   - There is no central server; all peers share resources directly with each other.

2. Resource Sharing:
   - Resources like files, storage, and processing power are distributed among all peers.
   - Each peer can initiate or complete a transaction, and data can be exchanged directly between peers.

3. Scalability:
   - Generally more scalable for smaller networks, as each additional peer adds more resources to the network.
   - Performance may degrade as the number of peers increases, especially without proper management and protocols.

4. Cost:
   - Usually less expensive to set up and maintain because there is no need for dedicated servers.
   - Each peer contributes its own resources, reducing the need for centralized infrastructure.

5. Management:
   - More complex to manage as the network grows, since each peer must be individually managed and configured.
   - Security and data consistency can be challenging to maintain due to the distributed nature.

6. Examples:
   - File-sharing networks like BitTorrent, decentralized applications, and blockchain technology.

 Client-Server Network Architecture:

1. Structure:
   - In a client-server network, there is a central server that provides resources and services to client devices.
   - Clients request services or resources from the server, which processes and responds to those requests.

2. Resource Sharing:
   - Resources are centralized on the server, which manages and distributes them to clients as needed.
   - Clients typically do not share their resources with other clients directly.

3. Scalability:
   - Generally more scalable for larger networks, as the central server can be upgraded to handle more clients.
   - Can efficiently manage and serve a large number of clients with proper server capacity.

4. Cost:
   - Higher initial setup and maintenance costs due to the need for dedicated server hardware and infrastructure.
   - Servers require regular maintenance, updates, and potentially additional hardware as the network grows.

5. Management:
   - Easier to manage, as the central server controls resources, security, and user access.
   - Centralized management simplifies tasks like data backup, security updates, and user authentication.

6. Examples:
   - Web servers, email servers, database servers, and enterprise networks where clients access centralized services.

 Summary:

- Peer-to-Peer: Decentralized, equal peer status, direct resource sharing, lower cost, more complex management, suitable for smaller networks.
- Client-Server: Centralized, distinct client and server roles, centralized resource sharing, higher cost, easier management, suitable for larger networks.

Each architecture has its own advantages and is suitable for different types of applications and network environments.
