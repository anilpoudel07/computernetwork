1. Ip address        : 192.168.1.3
2. Subnet Mask       : 255.255.255.0
3. Network address   : 192.168.1.0
4. Broadcast address : 192.168.1.255

5. Total number of end devices that my network can support is: 
	2^8-2=254
=> 2 is subtracted because one of the address is networking address and another is broadcasting address.
