## UDP header

1. **Source Port: 53 (DNS)**
   - **Description**: This is the port number on the sender's side. Port 53 is standard for DNS services, meaning this datagram is likely part of a DNS query or response.

2. **Destination Port: 57123 (random high port)**
   - **Description**: This is the port number on the receiver's side. High port numbers (above 1023) are often dynamically assigned by the operating system for client-side communication.

3. **Length: 112 bytes**
   - **Description**: This field specifies the total length of the UDP datagram, including both the header and the data. In this case, the entire datagram is 112 bytes long. Given the UDP header is 8 bytes, the data payload is 104 bytes.

4. **Checksum: 0x1606 (unverified)**
   - **Description**: This field is used for error-checking of the header and data. The checksum helps ensure data integrity by allowing the receiver to detect errors in the transmitted datagram. This particular checksum is unverified, meaning it has been provided but not yet validated for correctness.
