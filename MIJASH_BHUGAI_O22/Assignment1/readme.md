**IP address** : 192.168.18.64

**Subnet Mask** : 255.255.255.0 or /24

**Network address** : 192.168.18.0

**Broadcast address** : 192.168.18.255


Total number of end devices that my network can support can be calculated by using
subnet mask.
*Network bits* = 24
*host bits* = 8
hence supported end devices = 2^8-2=254
We subtracted 2 because one of the address is network address and where first 8
bits from right hand side will all be 0 and of the address is broadcasting address
where first 8 bits will be all 1 .
